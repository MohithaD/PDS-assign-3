# pip install pandas, nltk and word cloud 
import pandas, nltk and word cloud so that we can execute the code with required libraries present.
# Part - A
Tokenize every OriginalTweet column using iterative loops and add the tokens to a list.
# Part - B
Removing all the stop words with the help of the stopwords function and appeding all the tokens left.
# Part - C
Iterating every token and counting the frequency of each word/token using nltk library and Counter function from the collections library.
# Part - D
By using word cloud function from nltk library, we first join all the tokens into a list and combining the list into a single string to build a word cloud and thereby plotting the word cloud.
